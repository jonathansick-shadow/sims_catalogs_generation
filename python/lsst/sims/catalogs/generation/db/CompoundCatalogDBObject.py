class CompoundCatalogDBObject(CatalogDBObject):
    """
    This is a class for taking several CatalogDBObject daughter classes that
    query the same table of the same database for the same rows (but different
    columns; note that the columns can be transformed by the CatalogDBObjects'
    self.columns member), and combining their queries into one.

    You feed the constructor a list of CatalogDBObject daughter classes.  The
    CompoundCatalogDBObject verifies that they all do, indeed, query the same table
    of the same database.  It then constructs its own self.columns member (note
    that CompoundCatalogDBObject is a daughter class of CatalogDBObject) which
    combines all of the requested data.

    When you call query_columns, a recarray will be returned as in a CatalogDBObject.
    Note, however, that the names of the columns of the recarray will be modified.
    If the first CatalogDBObject in the list of CatalogDBObjects passed to the constructor
    asks for a column named 'col1', that will be mapped to 'catName_col1' where 'catName'
    is the CatalogDBObject's objid member.  'col2' will be mapped to 'catName_col2', etc.
    In cases where the CatalogDBObject does not change the name of the column, the column
    will also be returned by its original, un-mangled name.

    In cases where a custom query_columns method must be implemented, this class
    can be sub-classed and the custom method added as a member method.  In that
    case, the _table_restriction member variable should be set to a list of table
    names corresponding to the tables for which this class was designed.  An
    exception will be raised if the user tries to use the CompoundCatalogDBObject
    class to query tables for which it was not written.  _table_restriction defaults
    to None, which means that the class is for use with any table.
