This contains the main functions to be used for generating catalogs of moving
object sources. 
Builds on movingObject (a class which contains information on a single moving object, 
   including its orbit at an epoch and potentially multiple ephemerides) 
  and movingObjectList (a class which operates on groups of movingObjects, primarily
   intended to make ephemeris generation faster for many objects at the same ephem_date [shortcut calls to fortran],
   as well as make calculating magnitudes faster for many objects). 

Call buildMovingObjectCatalog with an RA(deg)/Dec(deg) of pointing, radius of the field of view(deg),
 and MJD-TAI time of the exposure. Will produce two ephemerides, separated by 
 dtExp(in seconds) .. the time between exposure 1 and exposure 2
Returns list of lists of objects, plus description of what is in each object

Call fixMovingObjectCatalog with an RA(deg)/Dec(deg) of pointing, radius of the field of view(deg),
 and MJD-TAI time of the exposure, AND the filename containing a list of object id's that are expected in the fov.
 Will produce two ephemerides, separated by dtExp(seconds). 
Returns list of lists of objects, plus description of what is in each object
